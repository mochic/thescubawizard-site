# thescubawizard-site

Mobile first dive website built with [gatsbyjs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics), [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring), and many more.

## integration local testing

via env vars, .env, etc...

- GATSBY_ACTIVE_ENV = production
- GATSBY_CONTACT_INFO_ENDPOINT = the contact info post endpoint

## notes

- Why does this project use `prop-types`? Isn't that a relic from a different time?
  - yeah...:/...but I'm experimenting with a lot of new packages here and wanted to limit the number of new things that weren't absolutely necessary for actually getting something "out the door"
